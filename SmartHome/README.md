# My Smart Home Project

## <u>Why are we doing this?</u>

The project involved creating an API to demonstrate my understanding of Java that has been delivered through online training.

The main theory of Java was taught to understand the code and why and where code was entered and what it meant. We learnt how to create a database and the code specifications needed to connect a H2 or MySQL database.

From this, we began to learn how to use Spring Boot and Maven. We then moved to learning how to expanding the use of H2/SQL in addition to configuring classes with Lombok. Finally, we learnt how to test our project code using JUnit and Mockito.

To show how we progressed throughout the creation of the API, we were required to use version control to illustrate the development path in GitHub and then merge into the main branch - the testing code needed to work before the project could be complete.

I have a passion for Smart Home and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. I enjoy researching about IoT and new products coming to the market, in particular, the new "matter" unified protocol that will enable all IoT devices to connect regardless of brand, hub or eco-system specific requirements(a software update will be pushed to all existing devices on sale that can integrate into the matter protocol).

## <u>How I expected the challenge to go</u>

When I was thinking of a project, I came up with an idea to add data of IoT devices and cross reference them against each other. For example, Samsung SmartThings devices didn't work with devices in the Amazon ecosystem. Through the evolution of "matter", manufactuers are now <i>"future proofing"</i> their devices.

My database collects the data required that will let someone see whether their devices will work with the new matter protocol. The aim was to highlight any devices that are not capable of working with "matter". I added <i>"generation"</i> data to determine whether the device is no longer being manufactured but are still active and being used. Clearly, any older devices are likely to have stopped being produced by the manufacturers due to older technology.

I was faily confident with my understanding of the code and what I need to write to complete each class but I also had reservations on whether the code I write was correct. It's fine to not see any errors in the editor but that doesn't mean it actually works.

## <u>What went well?</u>

Through the process of the project, I became more confident with my understanding of the requirements for the project and what I needed to create to fulfill the objections of the project.

## <u>What didn't go as planned?</u>

I struggled with the testing element of the project. I found that I had to revist some training and do some research when I found an error in my code. I always make it a point to try to look for the answer myself and if that fails, seek help from our trainer.

I had problems with the connection to the H2 database and I also had difficulties understanding the requirements for the version control. My lack of understanding in this area meant that I didn't push any of my code to Github whilst it was being built. 

## <u>Possible Improvements for future revisions of the project.</u>

One main area is understanding how the testing in Spring works using JUnit, MockMvc and Mockito. I will need to revist this until I fully understand it. This did hamper my progress in the project.

I would also ensure that I use version control correctly. Although I know the basics of Git and Github, not grasping the steps to create the respository and push code seemed to me, to be something I should know but for whatever reason, I get a memory block when revisiting this later in the project.
